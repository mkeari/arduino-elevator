# Three-floor Elevator
Elevator with 3 levels controlled by Arduino (Mega)

The aim of the project was to design and implement a simulation of real fully functional 3-floor elevator with all its features such as ability to transport objects within the floors, smart doors, overweight system and fire alarm system. The simulation consists of the functional breadboard with implemented logic using Arduino integrated into the prototype elevator built using carton. This project is a good practice of solving real life problems using the knowledge and experience obtained during this course.

# Materials and Methods 
-	Arduino Mega 
-	Breadboard
-	2-wire motor as a main motor which move the elevator cage within the floors
-	Servo motor as a motor responsible for opening and closing the door
-	Proximity sensor to define is there any object (human) going through entry while door is open
-	Force sensor to prevent the elevator from the overweight 
-	Thermistor to detect a fire and turn on fire alarm 
-	4 push-buttons (small) – 3 buttons for calling elevator on each floor and 1 button for emergency situation alarm 
-	LED (Red) as one of the indicators of alarm
-	Wires
-	Resistors for push-buttons, sensors and LED
-	Carton box, metal beams, string and scotch tape to build the elevator
